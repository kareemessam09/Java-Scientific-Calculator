# Java-Scientific-Calculator999
Java-Scientific-Calculator is an implementation project on Java OOP concepts


# A glance at “Calculator999”
Calculator999 is a project for a calculator application designed using OOP Java that
allows the user to perform typical calculations by displaying its options on the main screen. 
The program runs continuously so the user can do as many operations as required. 
The modes Calculator612 offers are:
▪ Matrix calculator
▪ Basic operations calculator
▪ Trigonometric functions calculator
▪ Base converter 
▪ Special calculator
▪ Function analysis mode
▪ Unit converter
▪ Shapes mode
After finishing the desired operations, the user can pick the Quit option to close the program.
Let's take a closer look at those modes, which represent the core classes of the project:

# 1st class “Matrix Calculator”
This class contains all operations that involve matrixes. It takes a matrix as an input and provides 
the function to add 2 matrices, subtract 2 matrices, multiply 2 matrices, get the inverse, get 
the transpose, and finally get the determinant.

# 2nd class “Basic Operations Calculator”
This class is responsible for common calculations like addition, subtraction, division, 
multiplication, and modulus.

# 3rd class “Trigonometric Function Calculator”
This class takes an angle as an input and calculates all its trigonometric functions, like sin(Ɵ), 
cos(Ɵ), and tan(Ɵ), and then convert the measure of the angle from degree to radian and 
vice versa.

# 4th class “Base Converter”
This class converts any number expressed in the base-n numerical system to any desired 
base from 2–26. It offers three options to convert from decimal to binary, binary to decimal,
and base to base.

# 5th class “Special Calculator”
This class contains special operations as it takes a number input and calculates the factorial, 
the square root, the cubic root, the absolute value, the log, the modulus, and the power.

# 6th class “Function Analysis Mode”
This class analyzes linear and quadratic functions. It defines the domain
and the range for linear functions and provides a simple graph. For quadratic functions, it finds the roots, domain, 
and range.

# 7th class “unit converter”
As the name says, this class plays with units. It has four sections: length, temperature, speed, 
and mass. For each section, it offers many options to convert units.

# 8th class “shapes mode”
This class calculates the area of different shapes, from triangles to circles to squares. 
Accordingly, it takes the parameters of its shape as input.
